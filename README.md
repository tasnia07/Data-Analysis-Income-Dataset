# Data-Analysis-Income-Dataset
This is a lab assignment from Artificial Intelligence course consisting of follwoing tasks:

Perform classification and calculate accuracy using logistic regression (Use sklearn library). Perform necessary pre-processing on the dataset before classification. Use 8:2 train-test split.

Perform classification and calculate accuracy using decision tree (Use sklearn library). Perform necessary pre-processing on the dataset before classification. Use 8:2 train-test split.

Compare the accuracy and plot them as a bar chart using matplotlib/seaborn

Divide the dataset into 8:2 train-test split and perform Support Vector Machine, Neural Network (MLPClassifier) and Random Forest on it using sklearn library. 

Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA. Reduce the number of feature vectors into half (e.g. if your dataset has 10 columns, after applying PCA it should have 5 columns)

Apply Support Vector Machine, Neural Network (MLPClassifier) and Random Forest again on the reduced dataset.

Compare the accuracy of the pre-PCA and post-PCA results. Plot them against each other in a bar graph.
